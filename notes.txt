Allow the user to add new coffees to the page

Create another form on the page that has an input for the coffee name, and a select to choose the coffee roast. When the form is submitted, the new cofee should appear on the page. (Note that any new coffees you add will be lost when you refresh the page, for an extra challenge, research localStorage and see if you can find a way to persist the data)
