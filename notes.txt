Bonus

Style it!

The page looks pretty plain as it is, and the refactoring we did above to use divs for coffees should give us more flexibility in styling. (Hint: the styling shown in the example below can be achieved purely with bootstrap classes, that is, without custom CSS)

+Make page look like a cafe chalkboard
    Make body background black, possibly a seamless texture background
    Get creative fonts
    Change buttons to integrate into design plan

Allow the user to add new coffees to the page

Create another form on the page that has an input for the coffee name, and a select to choose the coffee roast. When the form is submitted, the new cofee should appear on the page. (Note that any new coffees you add will be lost when you refresh the page, for an extra challenge, research localStorage and see if you can find a way to persist the data)
